        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h2>
        
        <p class="post-text">Allah created the angels and the Jinn. Humans were not created yet. Jinns are made out of fire and air. Angels are made out of light. Among the Jinn are those that make good and bad choices. The angels always obey Allah. One of the Jinn was so obedient to Allah that he rose above the other Jinn. He was placed amongst the ranks of the angels. His name is Iblis which means someone who does not have any hope. Iblis also means someone who slanders and accuses. Shaytan means someone who has a lot of hate and consumes anger.</p>

        <p class="post-text">Allah is telling the angels that He will create a being of skin from mud. Many other creatures were created from mud on the earth from before. Allah tells the angels to prostrate when He is finished balancing him out. Then I will blow into him from my Ruh. Ruh is something that is comforting and calm. And what Allah created is so amazing that the angels should prostrate out of awe. All humans are worthy of the prostration of the angels. Allah honored and valued us so do not let anyone tell you that you are worthless. Allah molded us and crafted us into a work of art. Allah considered us a work of beauty.</p>
        
        <p class="post-text"> The angels and Iblis heard the announced and Iblis said nothing. The angels were not quiet and they addressed their concerns to Allah. Allah said He is leaving someone behind in charge on the earth. Jinns were left behind to make choices and they caused corruption . The angels addressed this concern. Iblis listened to the angels concerns but said nothing. Iblis felt something inside but he did not address his concerns. Everything we will learn about shaytan he wants us to feel what he felt. Iblis puts 100 thoughts in our head that are not true at all. Iblis let the negative attitude grow inside him. Iblis felt jealous of Adam. Iblis felt what he has is not worth anything when someone else has it.</p>

        <p class="post-text"> We were all created at the same time in the world of the souls. Different souls are bunched together. Our souls were present during this first creation of Adam. Allah chose Adam out of all the Ruh and put inside the body. Allah pulled out all of us from the back of Adam. Allah told Adam to name everyone, Adam knew all our names and qualities. Allah tells the angels to names these people. The angels say we do not have any knowledge You are Perfect. Then Adam tells the names and qualities of all of us. The angels see this light and goodness we have inside of us . The angels and Iblis are listening. After this long introduction all the angels prostrate.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَاكُمْ ثُمَّ صَوَّرْنَاكُمْ ثُمَّ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ فَسَجَدُوا إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ لَمْ يَكُنْ مِنَ السَّاجِدِينَ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">And We have certainly created you and given you human form. Then We said to the angels Prostrate to Adam so they prostrated except for Iblis. He was not of those who prostrated. When the angels fell into sajdah we are all watching. We see countless legions of angels all fall into sajdah. And one creature is just standing there still quiet.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">قَالَ مَا مَنَعَكَ أَلَّا تَسْجُدَ إِذْ أَمَرْتُكَ ۖ قَالَ أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِنْهُ خَلَقْتَنِي مِنْ نَارٍ وَخَلَقْتَهُ مِنْ طِينٍ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Allah said What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you? Satan said I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay. They were commanded to prostrate before Adam was created. The angels had a concern and Allah addressed the concern. And now the angels are convinced and so they prostrated. Iblis was quiet and when you are quiet you take your feelings and turn it into facts. This fact exists inside your head and no one can break it. Iblis created a reality inside his head that he is worthy instead of Adam. Allah proved the point to the angels because he is actually showing the reason to Iblis. Iblis had all the reasons to prostrate but he didn’t. Iblis is not doing sajdah because he is not impresses with what Allah created.</p> 
            
        <p class="post-text">Iblis mentioned what Adam was physically created from. But he failed to mention what was inside Adam such as the Ruh. Iblis believed that we are nothing more than animals. And animals are of lesser worth. Fire is used for hot temper and impulsiveness. Iblis said this is how Allah created me I cannot help it. Iblis’s heat attacking the human being actually makes us stronger. Iblis wants us to live a life of comparison and to be of lesser worth. Iblis was in the best place but he lowered himself when he compared himself to Adam. Iblis is miserable and he wants us to be miserable. Iblis was arrogant.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">قَالَ فَٱهْبِطْ مِنْهَا فَمَا يَكُونُ لَكَ أَن تَتَكَبَّرَ فِيهَا فَٱخْرُجْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلصَّـٰغِرِينَ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Allah said, “Then get down from Paradise! It is not for you to be arrogant here. So get out! You are truly one of the disgraced.” We are watching this scene and the announcement is given. We were all created for the earth. We are up in the proximity of paradise and we can see paradise. Allah mentions get out from paradise you have become small and insignifcant. Iblis is small and he wants us to feel small. Iblis has no control over us, he can only whisper to us. Iblis wants us to believe that he is big and powerful but he is in fact very small.</p>

        <p class="post-text">Arrogance is to come up with your own reality even though the facts are presented to you. It is also feeling that you want what other people have. The need to compare and being jealous. Arrogance is also about being insecure. Arrogance is bringing someone lower so you can look like you are higher.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">قَالَ أَنظِرْنِىٓ إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Satan said, “Then delay my end until the Day of their resurrection.” They is referring to all of us, the children of Adam. Iblis and all of us already knew about the day of judgement. Allah created this earth and He wanted to put a khalifa on this earth. Allah asked all of creation if they want this responsibility. They all said no. Then Allah created us and asked us if we want to be tested like this. We all said Yes. We are more capable of passing this test because of the Ruh Allah has given us. Every single human being has the potential of attaining jannat ul firdaus, but at the end we have our only choice. We are shown what tests we are given and the reward we will get. We all said yes. The human being was in a hurry to carry the load. We actually asked to be born. Iblis has an insatiable hate. It is not enough for Iblis to see Adam and Hawa to burn in hell. Iblis wants every single human being to burn in hell. The devilish quality is the need to prove yourself right and the inability to accept criticism.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">قَالَ إِنَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْمُنظَرِينَ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Allah said, “You are delayed until the appointed Day.” </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">قَالَ فَبِمَآ أَغْوَيْتَنِى لَأَقْعُدَنَّ لَهُمْ صِرَٰطَكَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Satan said, “Because You led me astray I will lie in ambush for them on Your Straight Path. Allah taught all of us about the Straight Path.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">ثُمَّ لَـَٔاتِيَنَّهُم مِّنۢ بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ وَعَنْ أَيْمَـٰنِهِمْ وَعَن شَمَآئِلِهِمْ ۖ وَلَا تَجِدُ أَكْثَرَهُمْ شَـٰكِرِينَ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">I will approach them from their front, their back, their right, their left, and then You will find most of them ungrateful.” You take one step towards Allah then Satan will put fear in you not to take a step forward. For every good choice there are a lot of bad choices. Like waking up for fajr the devil says you have time. From behind means you step away from something bad. The devil reminds you of the bad stuff you did. The devil tries to pull you back. The left is when the devil takes your sins and tells you it is not so bad. The right is when the devil lets you do good deeds and makes you feel like you are better. In all these directions Iblis wants us to disobey Allah. If we stray from the straight path then we will be ungrateful for everything Allah has given us.</p>
        
        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">قَالَ ٱخْرُجْ مِنْهَا مَذْءُومًۭا مَّدْحُورًۭا ۖ لَّمَن تَبِعَكَ مِنْهُمْ لَأَمْلَأَنَّ جَهَنَّمَ مِنكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Allah said, “Get out of Paradise! You are disgraced and rejected! I will certainly fill up Hell with you and your followers all together.” Iblis has negative thoughts and those thoughts are crushing himself over and over again. With this reason Iblis will never repent. Iblis wants us to crush ourselves with negative thoughts so we do not repent. Iblis hears the Quran but he is too immersed in his negative thinking for the Quran to purify him. Allah pointed at us when saying whoever follows Iblis will be in hell. We hear this then get worried and say we got this, we can make it to Jannah.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">وَيَـٰٓـَٔادَمُ ٱسْكُنْ أَنتَ وَزَوْجُكَ ٱلْجَنَّةَ فَكُلَا مِنْ حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَـٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلظَّـٰلِمِينَ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Allah said, “O Adam! Live with your wife in Paradise and eat from wherever you please, but do not approach this tree, or else you will be wrongdoers.” Now Allah is talking to Adam. There are three groups of people being addressed, us, Iblis, and Adam. Allah has conversed with Iblis and us already. Now Adam is being addressed directly. Allah is telling Adam live with your wife in Jannah temporarily before you go to the earth. Allah wanted the first human being to expierence what his children will be in forever. This way Adam can tell his children what he experienced and that can be passed on and on. Adam is with his wife in Jannah because Jannah is not Jannah without marriage. Jannah is amazing but not enjoyable alone. The first taste of paradise is a wholesome companionship. This is something Allah gave us on earth too. So Iblis will attack marriage first. Marriage consists of peace, love, and care. Without peace there is no love and care.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">فَوَسْوَسَ لَهُمَا ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنُ لِيُبْدِىَ لَهُمَا مَا وُۥرِىَ عَنْهُمَا مِن سَوْءَٰتِهِمَا وَقَالَ مَا نَهَىٰكُمَا رَبُّكُمَا عَنْ هَـٰذِهِ ٱلشَّجَرَةِ إِلَّآ أَن تَكُونَا مَلَكَيْنِ أَوْ تَكُونَا مِنَ ٱلْخَـٰلِدِينَ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Then Satan tempted them in order to expose what was hidden of their nakedness. He said, “Your Lord has forbidden this tree to you only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals.” The devil whispered to them then disappeared and whispered to them and disappeared. It happened over a long period of time. Shaytan took his sweet time. The devil slowly brought them near the tree. The devil takes one step then another step.</p>

        <p class="post-text">Human beings find honor in being covered with their clothes. Iblis was humiliated and he wants us to be humiliated. The best way to humiliate them is to have their clothes removed. After Satan whispered to them and they ate from the tree, their clothes were removed. Both Adam and Hawa felt shy and they started to cover themselves with the leaves of Jannah. Iblis did not want them happy to be human. He wanted them to be something else and change the creation of Allah.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">وَقَاسَمَهُمَآ إِنِّى لَكُمَا لَمِنَ ٱلنَّـٰصِحِينَ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">And he swore to them, “I am truly your sincere advisor.”</p>
