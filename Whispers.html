        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</h2>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Allah created the angels and the Jinn. Humans were not created yet. Jinns are made out of fire and air. Angels are made out of light. Among the Jinn are those that make good and bad choices. The angels always obey Allah. One of the Jinn was so obedient to Allah that he rose above the other Jinn. He was placed amongst the ranks of the angels. His name is Iblis which means someone who does not have any hope. Iblis also means someone who slanders and accuses. Shaytan means someone who has a lot of hate and consumes anger.</p>

        <p class="post-text">Allah is telling the angels that He will create a being of skin from mud. Many other creatures were created from mud on the earth from before. Allah tells the angels to prostrate when He is finished balancing him out. Then I will blow into him from my Ruh. Ruh is something that is comforting and calm. And what Allah created is so amazing that the angels should prostrate out of awe. All humans are worthy of the prostration of the angels. Allah honored and valued us so do not let anyone tell you that you are worthless. Allah molded us and crafted us into a work of art. Allah considered us a work of beauty.</p>
        
        <p class="post-text"> The angels and Iblis heard the announced and Iblis said nothing. The angels were not quiet and they addressed their concerns to Allah. Allah said He is leaving someone behind in charge on the earth. Jinns were left behind to make choices and they caused corruption . The angels addressed this concern. Iblis listened to the angels concerns but said nothing. Iblis felt something inside but he did not address his concerns. Everything we will learn about shaytan he wants us to feel what he felt. Iblis puts 100 thoughts in our head that are not true at all. Iblis let the negative attitude grow inside him. Iblis felt jealous of Adam. Iblis felt what he has is not worth anything when someone else has it.</p>

        <p class="post-text"> We were all created at the same time in the world of the souls. Different souls are bunched together. Our souls were present during this first creation of Adam. Allah chose Adam out of all the Ruh and put inside the body. Allah pulled out all of us from the back of Adam. Allah told Adam to name everyone, Adam knew all our names and qualities. Allah tells the angels to names these people. The angels say we do not have any knowledge You are Perfect. Then Adam tells the names and qualities of all of us. The angels see this light and goodness we have inside of us . The angels and Iblis are listening. After this long introduction all the angels prostrate.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading-2">وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَاكُمْ ثُمَّ صَوَّرْنَاكُمْ ثُمَّ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ فَسَجَدُوا إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ لَمْ يَكُنْ مِنَ السَّاجِدِينَ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">And We have certainly created you and given you human form. Then We said to the angels Prostrate to Adam so they prostrated except for Iblis. He was not of those who prostrated. When the angels fell into sajdah we are all watching. We see countless legions of angels all fall into sajdah. And one creature is just standing there still quiet.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading-2">قَالَ مَا مَنَعَكَ أَلَّا تَسْجُدَ إِذْ أَمَرْتُكَ ۖ قَالَ أَنَا خَيْرٌ مِنْهُ خَلَقْتَنِي مِنْ نَارٍ وَخَلَقْتَهُ مِنْ طِينٍ</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Allah said What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you? Satan said I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay. They were commanded to prostrate before Adam was created. The angels had a concern and Allah addressed the concern. And now the angels are convinced and so they prostrated. Iblis was quiet and when you are quiet you take your feelings and turn it into facts. This fact exists inside your head and no one can break it. Iblis created a reality inside his head that he is worthy instead of Adam. Allah proved the point to the angels because he is actually showing the reason to Iblis. Iblis had all the reasons to prostrate but he didn’t. Iblis is not doing sajdah because he is not impresses with what Allah created.</p> 
            
        <p class="post-text">Iblis mentioned what Adam was physically created from. But he failed to mention what was inside Adam such as the Ruh. Iblis believed that we are nothing more than animals. And animals are of lesser worth. Fire is used for hot temper and impulsiveness. Iblis said this is how Allah created me I cannot help it. Iblis’s heat attacking the human being actually makes us stronger. Iblis wants us to live a life of comparison and to be of lesser worth. Iblis was in the best place but he lowered himself when he compared himself to Adam. Iblis is miserable and he wants us to be miserable</p>
