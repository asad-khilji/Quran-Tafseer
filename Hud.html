        <h2 class="sub-heading">From Tawheed to Polytheism</h2>
        <p class="post-text">The people of Aad formed in a place called Ahkalf. Then polytheism began again. Allah sent an Arab prophet, Hud, to the people of Aad. No one was created like the people of Aad in terms of their strength. Allah had blessed them with great strength. They carved their homes out of mountains. Hud was from amongst the people. Hud said O my people worship Allah alone. He spoke to his people out of love. The people of Aad caused corruption on the land. Hud said listen to what I say I am not asking you for any compensation. The people of Aad called Hud a liar and a fool. Hud responded to them by saying I am not a fool, but a Messenger of the Master of the worlds. The people of Aad attacked the weak people and create grand palaces. Hud tells his people to fear Allah and warned them of a punishment. </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Punishment of Allah</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Hud makes dua to Allah to grant him victory against his own people. Allah tells Hud to be patience. A day will come the people of Aad will regret what they have done. They will have to answer for what they did on the day of judgement. Allah sent the first part of his punishment. For three years there was no rain. They start praying to their idols again. Then they hear a voice from the sky what kind of cloud do you want. They responded we want the black cloud because hey thought it would contain lots of rain. Instead Allah brought their destruction through that black cloud. An immense dark cloud covered the entire sky over the city. Then a big storm hits with freezing cold winds. These winds were very strong. The wind blew the people away. This wind blew for seven nights and eight days. this was a punishment for the people of Aad were rejected Hud. These people became like palm trees plucked out from the ground. The people of Aad were destroyed except for Hud and a few believers with him.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Lesson of this Story</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Allah shows us an example of how weak these people were. One soldier destroyed an entire nation. That one soldier is the wind.</p>
